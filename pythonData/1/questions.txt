R1. What is the difference between a host and an end system? List several differ-
ent types of end systems. Is a Web server an end system?

R2. Describe the protocol that might be used by two people having a telephonic
conversation to initiate and end the conversation.

R3. Why are standards important for protocols?


====================

R4. List six access technologies. Classify each one as home access, enterprise
access, or wide-area wireless access.

R5. Is HFC transmission rate dedicated or shared among users? Are collisions
possible in a downstream HFC channel? Why or why not?

R6. What access network technologies would be most suitable for providing
Internet access in rural areas?

R7. Dial-up modems and DSL both use the telephone line (a twisted-pair copper cable)
as their transmission medium. Why then is DSL much faster than dial-up access?

R8. What are some of the physical media that Ethernet can run over?

R9. Dial-up modems, HFC, DSL and FTTH are all used for residential access.
For each of these access technologies, provide a range of transmission rates
and comment on whether the transmission rate is shared or dedicated.

R10. Describe the different wireless technologies you use during the day and their
characteristics. If you have a choice between multiple technologies, why do
you prefer one over another?

====================

R11. Suppose there is exactly one packet switch between a sending host and a
receiving host. The transmission rates between the sending host and the
switch and between the switch and the receiving host are R 1 and R 2 , respec-
tively. Assuming that the switch uses store-and-forward packet switching,
what is the total end-to-end delay to send a packet of length L? (Ignore queu-
ing, propagation delay, and processing delay.)

R12. What advantage does a circuit-switched network have over a packet-switched
network? What advantages does TDM have over FDM in a circuit-switched
network?

R13. Suppose users share a 2 Mbps link. Also suppose each user transmits contin-
uously at 1 Mbps when transmitting, but each user transmits only 20 percent
of the time. (See the discussion of statistical multiplexing in Section 1.3.)
a. When circuit switching is used, how many users can be supported?
b. For the remainder of this problem, suppose packet switching is used. Why
will there be essentially no queuing delay before the link if two or fewer
users transmit at the same time? Why will there be a queuing delay if
three users transmit at the same time?
c. Find the probability that a given user is transmitting.
d. Suppose now there are three users. Find the probability that at any given
time, all three users are transmitting simultaneously. Find the fraction of
time during which the queue grows.

R14. Why will two ISPs at the same level of the hierarchy often peer with each
other? How does an IXP earn money?

R15. Why is a content provider considered a different Internet entity today? How
does a content provider connect to other ISPs? Why?


====================



R16. Consider sending a packet from a source host to a destination host over a
fixed route. List the delay components in the end-to-end delay. Which of
these delays are constant and which are variable?

R17. Visit the Transmission Versus Propagation Delay applet at the companion
Web site. Among the rates, propagation delay, and packet sizes available, find
a combination for which the sender finishes transmitting before the first bit of
the packet reaches the receiver. Find another combination for which the first
bit of the packet reaches the receiver before the sender finishes transmitting.

R18. A user can directly connect to a server through either long-range wireless
or a twisted-pair cable for transmitting a 1500-bytes file. The transmission
rates of the wireless and wired media are 2 and 100 Mbps, respectively.
Assume that the propagation speed in air is 3 3 10 8 m/s, while the speed in 
the twisted pair is 2 3 10 8 m/s. If the user is located 1 km away from the
server, what is the nodal delay when using each of the two technologies?

R19. Suppose Host A wants to send a large file to Host B. The path from Host A to Host
B has three links, of rates R 1 = 500 kbps, R 2 = 2 Mbps, and R 3 = 1 Mbps.
a. Assuming no other traffic in the network, what is the throughput for the
file transfer?
b. Suppose the file is 4 million bytes. Dividing the file size by the through-
put, roughly how long will it take to transfer the file to Host B?
c. Repeat (a) and (b), but now with R 2 reduced to 100 kbps.

R20. Suppose end system A wants to send a large file to end system B. At a very
high level, describe how end system A creates packets from the file. When
one of these packets arrives to a router, what information in the packet does
the router use to determine the link onto which the packet is forwarded?
Why is packet switching in the Internet analogous to driving from one city to
another and asking directions along the way?

R21. Visit the Queuing and Loss applet at the companion Web site. What is the
maximum emission rate and the minimum transmission rate? With those
rates, what is the traffic intensity? Run the applet with these rates and deter-
mine how long it takes for packet loss to occur. Then repeat the experiment
a second time and determine again how long it takes for packet loss to occur.
Are the values different? Why or why not?



====================




R22. If two end-systems are connected through multiple routers and the data-link
level between them ensures reliable data delivery, is a transport protocol offer-
ing reliable data delivery between these two end-systems necessary? Why?

R23. What are the five layers in the Internet protocol stack? What are the principal
responsibilities of each of these layers?

R24. What do encapsulation and de-encapsulation mean? Why are they needed in
a layered protocol stack?

R26. You are in a university classroom and you want to spy on what websites your
classmates are visiting with their laptops during the course lecture. If they all con-
nect to the Internet through the universityâ€™s WiFi network, what could you do?

R27. Describe how a botnet can be created and how it can be used for a DDoS attack.

R28. Suppose Alice and Bob are sending packets to each other over a computer
network. Suppose Trudy positions herself in the network so that she can
capture all the packets sent by Alice and send whatever she wants to Bob; she
can also capture all the packets sent by Bob and send whatever she wants to
Alice. List some of the malicious things Trudy can do from this position.
