R1. What is meant by a control plane that is based on per-router control? In such
cases, when we say the network control and data planes are implemented
'monolithically,' what do we mean?

R2. What is meant by a control plane that is based on logically centralized
control? In such cases, are the data plane and the control plane implemented
within the same device or in separate devices? Explain.

====================

R3. Compare and contrast the properties of a centralized and a distributed routing
algorithm. Give an example of a routing protocol that takes a centralized and
a decentralized approach.

R4. Compare and contrast static and dynamic routing algorithms.

R5. What is the 'count to infinity' problem in distance vector routing?

R6. How is a least cost path calculated in a decentralized routing algorithm?
SECTIONS 5.3–5.4

R7. Why are different inter-AS and intra-AS protocols used in the Internet?

R8. True or false: When an OSPF route sends its link state information, it is sent
only to those nodes directly attached neighbors. Explain.

R9. What is meant by an area in an OSPF autonomous system? Why was the
concept of an area introduced?

R10. Define and contrast the following terms: subnet, prefix, and BGP route.

R11. How does BGP use the NEXT-HOP attribute? How does it use the AS-PATH
attribute?

R12. Describe how a network administrator of an upper-tier ISP can implement
policy when configuring BGP.

R13. True or false: When a BGP router receives an advertised path from its neighbor,
it must add its own identity to the received path and then send that new
path on to all of its neighbors. Explain.
====================

R14. Describe the main role of the communication layer, the network-wide state 
management layer, and the network-control application layer in an SDN
controller.

R15. Suppose you wanted to implement a new routing protocol in the SDN control
plane. At which layer would you implement that protocol? Explain.

R16. What types of messages flow across an SDN controller’s northbound and
southbound APIs? Who is the recipient of these messages sent from the
controller across the southbound interface, and who sends messages to the
controller across the northbound interface?

R17. Describe the purpose of two types of OpenFlow messages (of your choosing)
that are sent from a controlled device to the controller. Describe the purpose
of two types of Openflow messages (of your choosing) that are send from the
controller to a controlled device.

R18. What is the purpose of the service abstraction layer in the OpenDaylight SDN
controller?
====================

R19. Names four different types of ICMP messages

R20. What two types of ICMP messages are received at the sending host executing
the Traceroute program?

R21. Define the following terms in the context of SNMP: managing server,
managed device, network management agent and MIB.

R22. What are the purposes of the SNMP GetRequest and SetRequest messages?

R23. What is the purpose of the SNMP trap message?
