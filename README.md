## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

This is a simple web project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, since modern browsers may restrict some features (like loading local files via JavaScript), you'll need to run it using a local server.

### How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine: ```bash git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-quiz-master.git cd network-quiz-master
2. - **Run a local server** to host the files. Here are a few ways you can do this:

   - **Using VS Code's Live Server Extension**:

     1. Install the Live Server extension in VS Code.
     2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
     3. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server."

   - **Using Python (if installed)**

     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```

     Then, visit `http://localhost:8080`.

- **Start Quizzing!** Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the appropriate port for your server).
- in the script.js file you will find the list of all chapters questions change it if you want to be quizzed on one chapter or more
  ```js
  const ChaptersData = [
    ...CHAPTER1,
    ...CHAPTER2,
    ...CHAPTER3,
    ...CHAPTER4,
    ...CHAPTER5,
  ];
  ```
- the quiz questions are shuffeld if you want them to be in order change the shuffle parameter in the quizhandler (change the third parameter from true to false)
  ```js
  const Quiz = new QuizHandler(ChaptersData, ui, true);
  ```
